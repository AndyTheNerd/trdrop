trdrop - a cross platform fps analyzer for raw video data

#### Update 23.05.2019

Added more general options with a custom spinbox with text. Also tearoptions with a shared color option. Tooltips work on the general pane but not the others yet? Also got OpenCV running from a previous project on Linux, now porting it to Windows.

#### Update 14.05.2019

Got the fileitemmodel working with c++ and qml. Added transition animations because they look good. Now focusing on the options dialog. Hopefully this will be faster as the model will be the same implementation as the fileitem one.

#### Update 12.05.2019

Created the qt branch, currently building up the knowledge needed to use the Qt MVC model. Rebuilding the QML example to work from C++ to incorporate OpenCV.

This is the current progress video for the file choose dialog with ordering.

#### Update 24.04.2019

I'm currently working on a cross platform (Win/Linux) Qt based implementation. Currently testing some of the key functionalities in private repos. Stay tuned!

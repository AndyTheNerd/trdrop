trdrop - a cross platform fps analyzer for raw video data 

## Description

This software is used for analyzing raw video data, calculating framedrops and visualizing tears.
The result can be exported with an overlay displaying the information. For a more detailed description, look up the documentation in [docs](docs/documentation.pdf).

The projects implements the **trdrop_c** command line interface for Windows.
Development is done with `opencv` and whatever compiler Visual Studio 2017 is using.

The linux branch might progress if I have time to port the code.
